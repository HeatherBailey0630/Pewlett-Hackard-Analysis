# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of our analysis was to determine how many employees will be retiring from Pewlett-Hackard and provide the company with this information. PH needs to know who may be eligible for their retirement package, and how many positions will need to be filled. Using SQL we created a database, created a variety of different tables and exported the data as CSV files. We came up with all retiring employees, and the total count of employees retiring per department. We also created a list of those who will be eligible for the mentorship program.
## Results
- There are a total of 72,458 employees nearing retirement age.
- The majority of these employees are either Senior Engineers (25,916) or Senior Staff (24,926).
- Additionally, there are 9,285 Engineers, 7,636 Staff, 3,603 Technique Leaders, 1,090 Assistant Enginners, and 2 Managers retiring.
- We also discovered there are 1,549 employees eligible for the mentorship program.

**Retiring Employees By Department**

## Summary

With a total of 72,458 employees retiring, PH will need to come up with and implement a plan to fill these roles so the departments aren't negatively impacted. PH will need to promote from within, and recruit and hire numerous employees with various different skillsets. There are far more employees retiring, than employees eligible for the mentorship program.

There are only a total of 1,549 employees that are qualified to mentor the next generation of PH employees. 
- There are 25,916 Senior Engineers retiring, and only 300 Senior Engineers qualified for the mentorship program.
- There are 24,926 Senior Staff retiring, and only 410 Senior Staff qualified for the mentorship program.

It would be unrealistic for each of the mentors to mentor over 46 employees, so PH will need to come up with an alternate solution. 

Something PH could consider is the number employees who may be eligible for a promotion:

**Employees Eligible for Promotion**

These employees have worked at PH for between 22 and 35 years. Some may not be eligible for promotions, but they are still senior staff who have been with the company for a long period of time. Perhaps these employees could fill a number of these roles, because hiring low level staff (Staff, or Assistant Engineers) is much easier than filling these higher level positions. Additionally, they could help train the newly onboarded staff and those moving into their department.
